# Coding
Create separate ".js" files for each bundle of screens (related screens). Create separate styles for each screen as well. They can be imported manually at the top. When you're done with your screen, you can add it to the "App.js" stack navigator and it will be registered within the app. Look at "Login.js" for an example of how to navigate through the different screens.
