# What is Campus Connect?
Campus Connect is a cross-platform chat and social media app developed by USC students, for USC students. 

# Hardware Requirements
This dev environment is very intensive and will require a modern computer with at least 20gb of free space, 16gb of ram, and a 4 or more core processor from the past few years. 

iOS Development requires a Macintosh Computer.

We recommend a beefy desktop computer for Android Development and an M1 Mac for iOS development.
